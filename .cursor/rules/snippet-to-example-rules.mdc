# Converting a Snippet to Fullstack Example

Create a new folder for our snippet inside of example folder .
1. Copy `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, `src/index.tsx`, `public/index.html`, `public/github.css`, and `.gitignore` from the `chat-room-react` example folder (1) into the new snippet example folder. (1: `examples/chat-room-react`)
- Update index.html's github anchor link to point to `https://github.com/rivet-gg/actor-core/tree/main/examples/{insert example name}`
2. Copy the `actor-json.ts` file from the snippet folder into the file `actors/app.ts` in the example folder. Make sure its being exported & setup correctly (see example from `chat-room-react/actors/app.ts`: )
    ```
    // We get rid of the default export
    // export default ...

    // and instead...
    
    // Create and export the app
    export const app = setup({
        actors: { actor },
    });

    // Export type for client type checking
    export type App = typeof app;
    ```
3. Copy the `App.tsx` from the snippet folder into `src/App.tsx` file, and then make it export the main app class as `export default function ReactApp`
4. Ask for user review at this point and see if you should continue. If you continue:
5. Call `yarn install` and fix any type errors. Review to other `examples/*` folders for sample.

# NOTES
1. Everything should be installed wit yarn
2. Environment variables should be used for any LLM calls
- Make sure to use dotenv to put the env to use
3. Feel free to install any missing packages that were present in the original snippet.
