import DriverNote from '/snippets/driver-note.mdx';

The File System Driver is a simple file-based implementation designed for development and testing environments. It stores all worker state in local files, providing persistence between application restarts.

<DriverNote />

<Warning>
  The File System Driver is primarily intended for development and testing. For production environments, consider more robust options like Rivet or Cloudflare Workers.

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Install the required packages:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="npm">
        ```bash
        npm install rivetkit/file-system rivetkit/nodejs
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="yarn">
        ```bash
        yarn add rivetkit/file-system rivetkit/nodejs
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="pnpm">
        ```bash
        pnpm add rivetkit/file-system rivetkit/nodejs
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="bun">
        ```bash
        bun add rivetkit/file-system rivetkit/nodejs
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Create a simple server using the File System driver:

    ```typescript src/index.ts
    import { serve } from "@rivetkit/nodejs"
    import { FileSystemManagerDriver, FileSystemWorkerDriver, FileSystemGlobalState } from "@rivetkit/file-system";

    const fsState = new FileSystemGlobalState();
    serve(app, {
      topology: "standalone",
      drivers: {
        manager: new FileSystemManagerDriver(app, fsState),
        worker: new FileSystemWorkerDriver(fsState),
      },
    });
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Start your server:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="npm">
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="yarn">
        ```bash
        yarn dev
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="pnpm">
        ```bash
        pnpm dev
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="bun">
        ```bash
        bun dev
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Features

The File System driver provides several benefits for development:

- **Persistence**: Worker state is stored in files and persists between application restarts
- **Durability**: Data is written to disk, providing protection against process crashes
- **Visibility**: State files can be inspected for debugging purposes
- **No External Dependencies**: Doesn't require additional services like Redis

## Limitations

The File System driver has several limitations to be aware of:

- **Single Machine**: Only works within a single machine - not suitable for distributed environments 
- **Scalability**: Limited scalability beyond a single instance
- **Coordination**: Limited support for coordinated topology
- **Performance**: File I/O operations may be slower than in-memory alternatives

<Tip>
  For production environments or applications requiring distributed capabilities, consider using the [Rivet](/platforms/rivet) or [Cloudflare Workers](/platforms/cloudflare-workers) instead.
