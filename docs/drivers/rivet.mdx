See the [Rivet Platform](/platforms/rivet) documentation for complete setup instructions.

## Benefits

The Rivet driver offers several advantages:

- **Fully Managed**: No infrastructure to provision or maintain
- **Global Distribution**: Deploy actors globally with automatic region selection
- **Monitoring**: Built-in observability and performance metrics
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for what you use with no upfront costs
- **Partition Topology Support**: Optimized for the Partition topology for efficient scaling

<Tip>
  Rivet is a great choice for production deployments, offering enterprise-grade reliability without the operational overhead.
