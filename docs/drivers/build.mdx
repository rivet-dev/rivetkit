title: Building Drivers
---

Each driver implements common interfaces defined by ActorCore, including:

- **ActorDriver**: Manages actor state, lifecycle, and persistence
- **ManagerDriver**: Handles actor discovery, routing, and scaling
- **CoordinateDriver**: Facilitates peer-to-peer communication between actor instances (only relevant for the coordinated topology)

## Source Code Locations

Get started by looking at source code for the driver interfaces and existing drivers:

- **Driver Interfaces**
  - **ActorDriver*** `packages/actor-core/src/actor/runtime/driver.ts`
  - **ManagerDriver*** `packages/actor-core/src/actor/runtime/driver.ts`
  - **CoordinateDriver**: `packages/actor-core/src/topologies/coordinate/driver.ts`
- **Driver Implementations**
  - **Memory driver**: `packages/drivers/memory/`
  - **Redis driver**: `packages/drivers/redis/`
  - More drivers are available in `packages/drivers/`
