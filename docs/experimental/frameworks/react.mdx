<Warning title="Caution!">
This integration is unstable and not recommended for production use. If you're looking for a stable integration, please let us know by upvoting the issue on our [GitHub repository]().
</Warning>


## Getting Started

First, add Rivet's Actor Client SDK to your project.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i @rivet-gg/actor-client --save
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @rivet-gg/actor-client
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @rivet-gg/actor-client
```

```bash jsr
npx jsr add @rivet-gg/actor-client
```
</CodeGroup>

[Generate a Actor Manager endpoint by using the `rivet` CLI and guide here](/platforms/rivet). Then add the generated URL to your env file.

### Create React App / Vite

If you're using Create React App or Vite, you can put `ActorClientProvider` in `App.tsx`.

```tsx App.tsx
import { Client } from "@rivet-gg/actor-client";
import { ActorClientProvider } from "@rivet-gg/actor-client/unstable-react";

export const App = () => {
  const [actorClient] = useState(() => new ActorClient({
      endpoint: process.env.VITE_APP_ACTOR_ENDPOINT,
  }));

  return (
    <ActorClientProvider client={actorClient}>
      /* your other context providers / your app  */
    </ActorClientProvider>
  );
};
```

### Next.js Pages Router

If you're using Next.js Pages Router you can put `ActorClientProvider` in `_app.tsx`, or in the page where you're going to use actors.

```tsx {{"title": "pages/_app.tsx"}}
import { Client } from "@rivet-gg/actor-client";
import { ActorClientProvider } from "@rivet-gg/actor-client/unstable-react";

export const App = ({ Component, pageProps }) => {
  const [actorClient] = useState(() => new ActorClient({
      endpoint: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ACTOR_ENDPOINT,
  }));

  return (
    <ActorClientProvider client={actorClient}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ActorClientProvider>
  );
};
```

### Next.js App Router

If you're using Next.js app router you can put `ActorClientProvider` in `layout.tsx`, or in the layout where you're going to use actors. 
We recommend creating a new component for your providers as shown below, because this SDK needs to be initialized on the client side with `use client` directive.

<CodeGroup>
```tsx {{"title":"src/app/providers.tsx"}}
'use client';
import { Client } from "@rivet-gg/actor-client";
import { ActorClientProvider } from '@rivet-gg/actor-client/unstable-react';

export function Providers({
  children,
}) {
  const [actorClient] = useState(() => new ActorClient({
      endpoint: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ACTOR_ENDPOINT,
  }));

  return (
    <ActorClientProvider client={actorClient}>
      {children}
    </ActorClientProvider>
  )
}
```

```tsx {{"title": "src/app/layout.tsx"}}
import { Providers } from './providers';

export default function Layout({
  children,
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <Providers>{children}</Providers>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Creating an Actor

`useActor` is a hook that allows you to interact with actors in your React components. Pass to it a name of your actor, [and optionally any other create parameters](https://rivet.gg/docs/manage#options). It will connect to the actor, once the component is mounted, and disconnect when the component is unmounted. 

The hook also provides the actor's state, error, and loading status. Actor created by `useActor` is available to that particular component tree only. If you call `useActor` somewhere else (even with the same arguments), it will create a new actor instance. To share the actor between components, you can use React's context or a state management library. It's safe to pass `actor` instance to child components as a prop, as it does not change between renders.

Optionally, if you're using TypeScript, you can pass your Actor type to the hook to get the correct types for [actions](https://rivet.gg/docs/actions). 

<CodeGroup>
```tsx {{"title": "JavaScript"}}
import { useActor } from "@rivet-gg/actor-client/unstable-react";

export const MyComponent = () => {
  const [{ isLoading, error, actor }] = useActor({ name: "counter" }); // [!code focus]
  /* ... */
};
```
```tsx {{"title": "TypeScript"}}
import { useActor } from "@rivet-gg/actor-client/unstable-react";
import type CounterActor from "../your-path-to-actors-directory/your-actor-file-name"; // replace with your actor file path // [!code focus] 

export const MyComponent = () => {
  const [{ isLoading, error, actor }] = useActor<CounterActor>({ name: "counter" }); // [!code focus]
  /* ... */
};
```
</CodeGroup>

### Calling Actions

To call any defined action on the actor, you can use the `actor.actionName` syntax. Make sure to replace `actionName` with the name of the action you want to call. Be aware that these methods are asynchronous and return a promise.

<CodeGroup>
```tsx {{"title": "JavaScript"}}
import { useActor } from "@rivet-gg/actor-client/unstable-react";

export const MyComponent = () => {
  const [{ isLoading, error, actor }] = useActor({ name: "counter" });

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => actor.increment()}>Increment</button> // [!code focus]
    </div>
  );
};
```
```tsx {{"title": "TypeScript"}}
import { useActor } from "@rivet-gg/actor-client/unstable-react";
import type CounterActor from "../your-path-to-actors-directory/your-actor-file-name"; // replace with your actor file path

export const MyComponent = () => {
  const [{ isLoading, error, actor }] = useActor<CounterActor>({ name: "counter" });


  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => actor.increment())}>Increment</button> // [!code focus]
    </div>
  );
};
```
</CodeGroup>

### Events

To subscribe to actor events changes, you can use the `actor.on` method. 

```tsx {{"title": "TypeScript"}}
import { useActor } from "@rivet-gg/actor-client/unstable-react";

export const MyComponent = () => {
  const [{ isLoading, error, actor }] = useActor({ name: "counter" });

  useEffect(() => {
    const unsubscribe = actor.on("your event name", (event) => { // [!code focus]
      console.log(event); // [!code focus]
    }); // [!code focus]

    return () => { // [!code focus]
      unsubscribe(); // [!code focus]
    }; // [!code focus]
  }, []);
};

```

### Troubleshooting

#### JSX element implicitly has type 'any' because no interface 'JSX.IntrinsicElements' exists

If you're getting this error, you need to add types for React. Normally React does not come with types, so you need to tell Deno to use the types from the different package.

```tsx your-actor.tsx
// @deno-types=npm:@types/react
import React from "react";
```


### Advanced Usage

#### Server Driven UI

You can use the Actor actions to return React components. [This is done by using React Server Components paradigm](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components).

In order to render components from your Actor, you need to ensure that your Actor uses the RSC capabilities from the `@rivet-gg/actor` package. Your actions can receive props like any other React component.

```tsx {{"title": "your-actor.tsx"}}
import { actor } from "@rivet-gg/actor";
import { createRsc } from "@rivet-gg/actor/unstable-react";  // [!code focus]

// Helper function to get messages
const getMessages = (state) => {
  /* 
    your code for getting messages,
    either from state or external source
  */
  return state.messages || [];
};

// Create the actor with RSC support
const messageActor = actor({
  state: { messages: [] },
  
  // Set up RSC capabilities
  ...createRsc(), // [!code focus]
  
  actions: {
    // Action that returns a React component
    messages: (c, props: {limit: number}) => {  // [!code focus]
      const messages = getMessages(c.state);  // [!code focus]
      // [!code focus]
      return <ul>  // [!code focus]
        {messages.slice(0, props.limit).map((message) => (  // [!code focus]
          <li key={message.id}>{message.text}</li>  // [!code focus]
        ))}  // [!code focus]
      </ul> // [!code focus]
    } // [!code focus]
  }
});

export default messageActor;
```

Then, you can use the second return value of the `useActor` hook to use your RscActor's elements. Make sure to wrap those elements in `Suspense`.

```tsx {{"title": "your-component.tsx"}}
import { useActor } from "@rivet-gg/actor-client/unstable-react";
import type ActorName from "../your-path-to-actor.tsx"; // replace with your actor file path

export const MyComponent = () => {
  const [// [!code focus]
    state,// [!code focus]
    { messages: Messages }// [!code focus]
  ] = useActor<ActorName>({ name: "actor-name" }); // [!code focus]

  return (
    <Suspense> // [!code focus]
      <Messages limit={5} /> // [!code focus]
    </Suspense> // [!code focus]
  );
};
```


## Experimental Features

<Warning title="Caution!">
    Methods described below are unstable and may change in the future, do not use them in production.
</Warning>

### Manual RSC update

If you need to re-render the component when something happens in your actor, use `c.updateRsc()` method. This will trigger a re-render of the RSC elements in your actor. Behind the scenes, this method broadcasts an internal event `__rsc` that all RSC elements are listening to.

```tsx your-actor.tsx
import { actor } from "@rivet-gg/actor";
import { createRsc } from "@rivet-gg/actor/unstable-react";

const messageActor = actor({
  state: { messages: [] },
  
  // Set up RSC capabilities
  ...createRsc(),
  
  actions: {
    // Action that triggers RSC update
    updateMessages: (c) => {
      // Trigger an update to re-render RSC components
      c.updateRsc(); // [!code focus]
    },
    
    // RSC component action
    messages: (c, props: {limit: number}) => { 
      /* ... */
    }
  }
});
```

### `unstable_createActorHooks`

`unstable_createActorHooks` is a function that allows you to create type-safe hooks for your actors. It takes an actor name and returns a hook that can be used to interact with that actor. This is useful when you want to create a custom hook that encapsulates the logic for a specific actor and its types.

```tsx {{"title": "your-actor-hooks.tsx"}}

import { 
  unstable_createActorHooks
} from "@rivet-gg/actor-client/unstable-react";

export const { 
  useActor, 
  useActorEventCallback, 
  useActorRsc 
} = unstable_createActorHooks("counter");
```

#### `useActor`

`useActor` is a hook that allows you to interact with actors in your React components. Pass to it a name of your actor, [and optionally any other create parameters](https://rivet.gg/docs/manage#options). It will connect to the actor, once the component is mounted, and disconnect when the component is unmounted.

```tsx {{"title": "your-component.tsx"}}
import { useActor } from "./your-actor-hooks";

export const MyComponent = () => {
  const [{ isLoading, error, actor }] = useActor(); // [!code focus]

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => actor.increment()}>Increment</button> // [!code focus]
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### `useActorEventCallback`

`useActorEventCallback` is a hook that allows you to subscribe to actor events changes. It takes an event name and a callback function that will be called when the event is triggered. You do not need to wrap the callback in `useCallback` as the hook will handle that for you.

```tsx {{"title": "your-component.tsx"}}
import { useActorEventCallback } from "./your-actor-hooks";

export const MyComponent = ({ actor }) => {
  useActorEventCallback({ actor, event: "your event name"}, (event) => { // [!code focus]
    console.log(event); // [!code focus]
  }); // [!code focus]

  return null;
};
```

#### `useActorRsc`

`useActorRsc` is a hook that allows you to use React Server Components from your actor. It takes an actor instance and returns a function that can be used to render the RSC elements. Make sure to wrap those elements in Suspense. The second return value of the hook is the function to refetch the RSC elements. 

<Note>
    This hook won't re-render the component when the actor state changes. If you need to re-render the component when the actor state changes. Use the second return value of the hook to refetch the response.
</Note>

```tsx {{"title": "your-component.tsx"}}
import { useActorRsc } from "./your-actor-hooks";

export const MyComponent = ({ actor }) => {
  const [Messages, update] = useActorRsc({ actor, fn: 'messages' }); // [!code focus]

  return (
    <Suspense> // [!code focus]
      <Messages limit={5} /> // [!code focus]
    </Suspense> // [!code focus]
  );
};
```
