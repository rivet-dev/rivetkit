<Step title="Define your actor">
  Create a file `actors/app.ts` in your project with your actor definition:

  ```typescript actors/app.ts
  import { actor, setup } from "@rivetkit/actor";

  // Create actor
  const counter = actor({
	state: { count: 0 },
	actions: {
	  increment: (c, x: number) => {
		c.state.count += x;
		c.broadcast("newCount", c.state.count);
		return c.state.count;
	  }
	}
  });

  // Create the application
  export const app = setup({
	actors: { counter },
	cors: { origin: "*" } // Configure CORS for your production domains in production
  });

  // Export app type for client usage
  export type App = typeof app;
  ```
</Step>
