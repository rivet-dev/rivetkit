<Step title="Define your worker">
  Create a file `workers/app.ts` in your project with your worker definition:

  ```typescript workers/app.ts
  import { worker, setup } from "rivetkit";

  // Create worker
  const counter = worker({
	state: { count: 0 },
	actions: {
	  increment: (c, x: number) => {
		c.state.count += x;
		c.broadcast("newCount", c.state.count);
		return c.state.count;
	  }
	}
  });

  // Create the application
  export const app = setup({
	workers: { counter },
	cors: { origin: "*" } // Configure CORS for your production domains in production
  });

  // Export app type for client usage
  export type App = typeof app;
  ```
</Step>
