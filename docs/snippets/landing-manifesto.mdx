		Stateful serverless is the future of how applications will be architected.
	</p>
	<p class="landing-section-text">
		Startups increasingly build on <span class="highlight">stateful serverless</span> to <span class="highlight">ship faster</span>, achieve <span class="highlight">better performance</span>, and <span class="highlight">outscale databases like Postgres</span>. The <span class="highlight">actor model</span> – closely related to stateful serverless – has an established history in frameworks like <span class="highlight">Elixir</span>, <span class="highlight">Orleans</span>, and <span class="highlight">Akka</span>, though these typically involve steep learning curves and complex infrastructure. Cloudflare demonstrates the power of this approach, having <span class="highlight">built their entire infrastructure</span> – including R2, Workflows, and Queues – on their stateful serverless engine called Durable Objects.
	</p>
	<p class="landing-section-text">
		With years of experience in <span class="highlight">gaming infrastructure</span>, we've seen firsthand how the <span class="highlight">stateful serverless model</span> excels. After building numerous systems like matchmaking, chat, presence, and social networks using stateful serverless, <span class="highlight">we're convinced it's hands down the best way to build applications</span>. However, <span class="highlight">the ecosystem lacks accessibility and resources</span>.
	</p>
	<p class="landing-section-text">
		To popularize stateful serverless, we decided to build something that works for everyone. <span class="highlight">No vendor lock-in</span>, <span class="highlight">no steep learning curve</span>, and a <span class="highlight">community-driven approach</span> that brings the best ideas from different ecosystems together.
	</p>
	<p class="landing-section-text">
		At <span class="highlight">Rivet</span>, we maintain an <span class="highlight">open-source runtime</span> to run stateful serverless workloads – including RivetKit. We see maintaining RivetKit as a <span class="highlight">rising tide</span>: more people will build applications this way, and we hope to provide the best deployment, monitoring, and collaboration solution for this architecture.
