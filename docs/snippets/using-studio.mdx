## Developing with the Studio

![ActorCore Studio](/images/screenshots/studio/simple.png)

ActorCore includes a built-in development studio that provides a graphical interface for interacting with your actors during development. The studio includes **actor list**, **state inspector**, **RPC execution**, **connection monitoring**, and **event visualization**. Your code will also be **automatically hot-reloaded**.

To launch the studio, run the following command in your project directory:

<CodeGroup>
  ```sh npm
  npx @actor-core/cli@latest dev
  ```
  
  ```sh pnpm
  pnpm exec @actor-core/cli@latest dev
  ```
  
  ```sh yarn
  yarn @actor-core/cli@latest dev
  ```
  
  ```sh bun
  bunx @actor-core/cli@latest dev
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The studio will automatically start your app and open in your browser.
