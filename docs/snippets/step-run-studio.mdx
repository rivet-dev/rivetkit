<Step title="Start your RivetKit development server">
  Launch the development server with:

  <CodeGroup>
  ```sh npm
  npx rivetkit/cli@latest dev workers/app.ts
  ```

  ```sh pnpm
  pnpm exec rivetkit/cli@latest dev workers/app.ts
  ```

  ```sh yarn
  yarn rivetkit/cli@latest dev workers/app.ts
  ```

  ```sh bun
  bunx rivetkit/cli@latest dev workers/app.ts
  ```
  </CodeGroup>

  This will automatically start your app and open the studio in your browser. The studio supports hot-reloading, state inspection, visual RPC testing, and more debugging tools.
