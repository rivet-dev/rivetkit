<Step title="Start your ActorCore development server">
  Launch the development server with:

  <CodeGroup>
  ```sh npm
  npx @actor-core/cli@latest dev actors/app.ts
  ```

  ```sh pnpm
  pnpm exec @actor-core/cli@latest dev actors/app.ts
  ```

  ```sh yarn
  yarn @actor-core/cli@latest dev actors/app.ts
  ```

  ```sh bun
  bunx @actor-core/cli@latest dev actors/app.ts
  ```
  </CodeGroup>

  This will automatically start your app and open the studio in your browser. The studio supports hot-reloading, state inspection, visual RPC testing, and more debugging tools.
