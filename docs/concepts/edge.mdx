## Region selection

### Automatic region selection

By default, actors will choose the optimal region based on the client's location.

<Note>
	Under the hood, Rivet uses [Anycast routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anycast) to automatically find
	the best location for the client to connect to without relying on slow & expensive manual pinging process.
</Note>

### Manual region selection

The region a actor is created in can be overridden using region options:

```typescript client.ts
import { createClient } from "rivetkit/client";
import type { App } from "./src/index";

const client = createClient<App>("http://localhost:6420");

// Create actor in a specific region
const actor = await client.example.get({
  options: {
    create: {
      region: "atl"
    }
  }
});
```

See [Create & Manage Actors](/docs/manage) for more information.

## Available regions

See available regions [here](/docs/regions).

### Fetching region list

It's common to need to display a list of available regions in your application.

To fetch a full list of regions, you can use the `GET https://api.rivet.gg/regions` HTTP endpoint. See API documentation [here](/docs/api/actor/regions/list).

We don't recommend hard-coding the region list. This allows you to develop your application with a local development cluster.
