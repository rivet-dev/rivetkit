RivetKit provides a straightforward testing framework to build reliable and maintainable applications. This guide covers how to write effective tests for your actor-based services.

## Setup

To set up testing with RivetKit:

```bash
# Install Vitest
npm install -D vitest

# Run tests
npm test
```

## Basic Testing Setup

RivetKit includes a test helper called `setupTest` that configures a test environment with in-memory drivers for your actors. This allows for fast, isolated tests without external dependencies.

<CodeGroup>
```ts tests/my-actor.test.ts
import { test, expect } from "vitest";
import { setupTest } from "rivetkit/test";
import { app } from "../src/index";

test("my actor test", async (test) => {
  const { client } = await setupTest(test, app);
  
  // Now you can interact with your actor through the client
  const myActor = await client.myActor.get();
  
  // Test your actor's functionality
  await myActor.someAction();
  
  // Make assertions
  const result = await myActor.getState();
  expect(result).toEqual("updated");
});
```

```ts src/index.ts
import { actor, setup } from "rivetkit";

const myActor = actor({
  state: { value: "initial" },
  actions: {
    someAction: (c) => {
      c.state.value = "updated";
      return c.state.value;
    },
    getState: (c) => {
      return c.state.value;
    }
  }
});

export const registry = setup({
  use: { myActor }
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Testing Actor State

The test framework uses in-memory drivers that persist state within each test, allowing you to verify that your actor correctly maintains state between operations.

<CodeGroup>
```ts tests/counter.test.ts
import { test, expect } from "vitest";
import { setupTest } from "rivetkit/test";
import { app } from "../src/index";

test("actor should persist state", async (test) => {
  const { client } = await setupTest(test, app);
  const counter = await client.counter.get();
  
  // Initial state
  expect(await counter.getCount()).toBe(0);
  
  // Modify state
  await counter.increment();
  
  // Verify state was updated
  expect(await counter.getCount()).toBe(1);
});
```

```ts src/index.ts
import { setup } from "rivetkit";

const counter = actor({
  state: { count: 0 },
  actions: {
    increment: (c) => {
      c.state.count += 1;
      c.broadcast("newCount", c.state.count);
      return c.state.count;
    },
    getCount: (c) => {
      return c.state.count;
    }
  }
});

export const registry = setup({
  use: { counter }
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Testing Events

For actors that emit events, you can verify events are correctly triggered by subscribing to them:

<CodeGroup>
```ts tests/chat-room.test.ts
import { test, expect, vi } from "vitest";
import { setupTest } from "rivetkit/test";
import { app } from "../src/index";

test("actor should emit events", async (test) => {
  const { client } = await setupTest(test, app);
  const chatRoom = await client.chatRoom.get();
  
  // Set up event handler with a mock function
  const mockHandler = vi.fn();
  chatRoom.on("newMessage", mockHandler);
  
  // Trigger the event
  await chatRoom.sendMessage("testUser", "Hello world");
  
  // Wait for the event to be emitted
  await vi.waitFor(() => {
    expect(mockHandler).toHaveBeenCalledWith("testUser", "Hello world");
  });
});
```

```ts src/index.ts
import { actor, setup } from "rivetkit";

export const chatRoom = actor({
  state: { 
    messages: []
  },
  actions: {
    sendMessage: (c, username: string, message: string) => {
      c.state.messages.push({ username, message });
      c.broadcast("newMessage", username, message);
    },
    getHistory: (c) => {
      return c.state.messages;
    },
  },
});

// Create and export the app
export const registry = setup({
  use: { chatRoom }
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Testing Schedules

RivetKit's schedule functionality can be tested using Vitest's time manipulation utilities:

<CodeGroup>
```ts tests/scheduler.test.ts
import { test, expect, vi } from "vitest";
import { setupTest } from "rivetkit/test";
import { app } from "../src/index";

test("scheduled tasks should execute", async (test) => {
  // setupTest automatically configures vi.useFakeTimers()
  const { client } = await setupTest(test, app);
  const scheduler = await client.scheduler.get();
  
  // Set up a scheduled task
  await scheduler.scheduleTask("reminder", 60000); // 1 minute in the future
  
  // Fast-forward time by 1 minute
  await vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(60000);
  
  // Verify the scheduled task executed
  expect(await scheduler.getCompletedTasks()).toContain("reminder");
});
```

```ts src/index.ts
import { actor, setup } from "rivetkit";

const scheduler = actor({
  state: { 
    tasks: [],
    completedTasks: []
  },
  actions: {
    scheduleTask: (c, taskName: string, delayMs: number) => {
      c.state.tasks.push(taskName);
      // Schedule "completeTask" to run after the specified delay
      c.schedule.after(delayMs, "completeTask", taskName);
      return { success: true };
    },
    completeTask: (c, taskName: string) => {
      // This action will be called by the scheduler when the time comes
      c.state.completedTasks.push(taskName);
      return { completed: taskName };
    },
    getCompletedTasks: (c) => {
      return c.state.completedTasks;
    }
  }
});

export const registry = setup({
  use: { scheduler }
});
```
</CodeGroup>

The `setupTest` function automatically calls `vi.useFakeTimers()`, allowing you to control time in your tests with functions like `vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync()`. This makes it possible to test scheduled operations without waiting for real time to pass.

## Best Practices

1. **Isolate tests**: Each test should run independently, avoiding shared state.
2. **Test edge cases**: Verify how your actor handles invalid inputs, concurrent operations, and error conditions.
3. **Mock time**: Use Vitest's timer mocks for testing scheduled operations.
4. **Use realistic data**: Test with data that resembles production scenarios.

RivetKit's testing framework automatically handles server setup and teardown, so you can focus on writing effective tests for your business logic.
