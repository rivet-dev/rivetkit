import CreateActorCli from "/snippets/create-actor-cli.mdx";

Actors combine compute and storage into unified entities for simplified architecture. Actors seamlessly integrate with your existing infrastructure or can serve as a complete standalone solution.

## Quickstart

Run this to get started:

## What are actors good for?

Actors in ActorCore are ideal for applications requiring:

- **Stateful Services**: Applications where maintaining state across interactions is critical. For example, **Collaborative Apps** with shared editing and automatic persistence.
- **Realtime Systems**: Applications requiring fast, in-memory state modifications or push updates to connected clients. For example, **Multiplayer Games** with game rooms and player state.
- **Long-Running Processes**: Tasks that execute over extended periods or in multiple steps. For example, **AI Agents** with ongoing conversations and stateful tool calls.
- **Durability**: Processes that must survive crashes and restarts without data loss. For example, **Durable Execution** workflows that continue after system restarts.
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Systems that need to scale by distributing load across many instances. For example, **Realtime Stream Processing** for stateful event handling.
- **Local-First Architecture**: Systems that synchronize state between offline clients. For example, **Local-First Sync** between devices.

## Core Concepts

In ActorCore, each actor has these key characteristics:

- **State Is Automatically Persisted**: State automatically persists between restarts, upgrades, & crashes
- **State Is Stored In-Memory**: State is stored in memory for high-performance reads/writes while also automatically persisted
- **Isolated State Ownership**: Actors only manage their own state, which can only be modified by the actor itself
- **Communicates via Remote Procedure Calls**: How clients and other actors interact with an actor
- **Remote Procedure Calls Are Low-Latency**: RPCs provide WebSocket-like performance for time-sensitive operations
- **Broadcast Updates With Events**: Actors can publish real-time updates to connected clients

## Code Example

Here's a complete chat room actor that maintains state and handles messages. We'll explore each component in depth throughout this document:

```typescript chat_room.ts
import { Actor, type Rpc } from "actor-core";

// Define the actor's state structure
interface State {
  messages: { sender: string; text: string; }[];
}

export default class ChatRoom extends Actor<State> {
  // Initialize state when the actor is first created
  _onInitialize(): State {
    return { messages: [] };
  }

  // RPC method clients can call
  sendMessage(rpc: Rpc<ChatRoom>, sender: string, text: string) {
    // Update state
    this._state.messages.push({ sender, text });
    
    // Broadcast to all connected clients
    this._broadcast("newMessage", { sender, text });
  }
  
  // RPC to get chat history
  getHistory(rpc: Rpc<ChatRoom>) {
    return this._state.messages;
  }
}
```

## Key Actor Components

### State

Actors maintain state that's stored in memory and automatically persisted. State is created in the `_onInitialize` method:

```typescript
import { Actor } from "actor-core";

interface State {
  count: number;
}

export default class Counter extends Actor<State> {
  _onInitialize(): State {
    return { count: 0 };
  }
}
```

Update state by modifying `this._state`:

```typescript
import { Actor, type Rpc } from "actor-core";

interface State {
  count: number;
}

export default class Counter extends Actor<State> {
  // Example of state update method
  increment(rpc: Rpc<Counter>) {
    this._state.count += 1;
  }
}
```

These changes are durable and are automatically persisted across updates, restarts, and crashes.

### Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs)

RPCs are methods on your actor class that clients & other actors can call. They must accept parameter of type `Rpc<Actor>` as the first argument:

```typescript
import { Actor, type Rpc } from "actor-core";

export default class Example extends Actor {
  multiplyByTwo(rpc: Rpc<Example>, x: number) {
    return x * 2;
  }
}
```

Private methods starting with `_` or `#` cannot be called by clients:

```typescript
import { Actor, type Rpc } from "actor-core";

export default class Example extends Actor {
  // Private - not callable by clients
  #calculateFee(amount: number) {
    return amount * 0.05;
  }

  // Public - callable by clients
  processPayment(rpc: Rpc<Example>, amount: number) {
    const fee = this.#calculateFee(amount);
    // Process payment logic...
    return { amount, fee };
  }
}
```

### Events

Actors can broadcast events to connected clients:

```typescript
import { Actor, type Rpc } from "actor-core";

interface State {
  items: string[];
}

export default class Inventory extends Actor<State> {
  _onInitialize(): State {
    return { items: [] };
  }
  
  addItem(rpc: Rpc<Inventory>, item: string) {
    // Add to state
    this._state.items.push(item);
    
    // Notify all clients about the new item
    this._broadcast("itemAdded", { item });
  }
}
```

You can also send events to specific clients:

```typescript
import { Actor, type Rpc } from "actor-core";

export default class MessageService extends Actor {
  sendPrivateMessage(rpc: Rpc<MessageService>, userId: string, text: string) {
    // Send to a specific connection
    const connection = this._connections.find(c => c.parameters.userId === userId);
    if (connection) {
      connection.send("privateMessage", { text });
    }
  }
}
```

## Actor Tags

Tags are key-value pairs attached to actors that serve two purposes:

1. **Actor Discovery**: Find specific actors using `client.get(tags)`
2. **Organization**: Group related actors for management purposes

The `name` tag is required and identifies the actor type.

```typescript
// Tags for a chat room actor
{
  name: "chat_room",
  channel: "general"
}
```

### Common Tag Patterns

Tags help clients find the right actor instance. Here are some common patterns:

```typescript
// Game room by code
const gameRoom = await client.get<GameRoom>({
  name: "game_room",
  roomCode: "ABC123"
});

// User-specific actor
const userProfile = await client.get<UserProfile>({
  name: "user_profile",
  userId: "1234"
});

// Document with workspace
const document = await client.get<Document>({
  name: "document",
  workspaceId: "team-alpha",
  documentId: "budget-2024"
});
```

## Actor Lifecycle

Actors are created automatically when needed and persist until explicitly shutdown.

To shut down an actor, use `this._shutdown()` from within an RPC:

```typescript
import { Actor, type Rpc } from "actor-core";

interface State {
  messages: { sender: string; text: string; }[];
}

export default class ChatRoom extends Actor<State> {
  closeRoom(rpc: Rpc<ChatRoom>) {
    // Do any cleanup needed
    this._broadcast("roomClosed");
    
    // Shutdown the actor
    this._shutdown();
  }
}
```
