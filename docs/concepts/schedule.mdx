Scheduling is used to trigger events in the future. The actor scheduler is like `setTimeout`, except the timeout will persist even if the actor restarts, upgrades, or crashes.

## Use Cases

Scheduling is helpful for long-running timeouts like month-long billing periods or account trials.

## Scheduling

### `after(duration, fn, ...args)`

Schedules a function to be executed after a specified duration. This function persists across actor restarts, upgrades, or crashes.

Parameters:

- `duration` (number): The delay in milliseconds.
- `fn` (string): The name of the method on the actor to be executed.
- `...args` (unknown[]): Additional arguments to pass to the function.

### `at(timestamp, fn, ...args)`

Schedules a function to be executed at a specific timestamp. This function persists across actor restarts, upgrades, or crashes.

Parameters:

- `timestamp` (number): The exact time in milliseconds since the Unix epoch when the function should be executed.
- `fn` (string): The name of the method on the actor to be executed.
- `...args` (unknown[]): Additional arguments to pass to the function.

## Full Example

```typescript
import { Actor, type Rpc } from "actor-core";

interface State {
  count: number;
}

export default class ScheduledCounter extends Actor<State> {
  async _onInitialize(): Promise<State> {
    return {
      count: 0,
    };
  }

  _increment(x: number) {
    this._state.count += x;
  }

  async delayedIncrement(rpc: Rpc<ScheduledCounter>, x: number): Promise<void> {
    // Increment the counter after 5 seconds
    this.after(5000, "_increment", x);
  }
}
```
