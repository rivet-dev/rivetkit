Events are used for clients to receive realtime data from actors.

<Info>Events are used for actors to publish updates to clients. Clients call actions to communicate with the actor.</Info>

## Publishing from actors

Actors can publish events to clients using `c.broadcast` and `connection.send`.

### Broadcasting events

Actors can publish events to all connected clients with `c.broadcast(name, data)`. For example:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript chat_room.ts
import { actor } from "actor-core";

const chatRoom = actor({
  state: {},
  actions: {
    sendMessage: (c, message) => {
      c.broadcast('newMessage', { message });
    }
  }
});
```

```typescript client.ts
import { createClient } from "actor-core/client";
import type { App } from "./src/index";

const client = createClient<App>("http://localhost:6420");
const chatRoom = await client.chatRoom.get();
await chatRoom.sendMessage('Hello, world!');
```

</CodeGroup>

### Sending events to specific connections

Actors can send messages to specific client connections. All connections are available through the context object. For example:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript chat_room.ts
import { actor } from "actor-core";

const chatRoom = actor({
  state: {},
  actions: {
    sendPrivateMessage: (c, connectionId, message) => {
      const conn = c.connections.find(conn => conn.id === connectionId);
      if (conn) {
        conn.send('newMessage', { message });
      }
    }
  }
});
```

```typescript client.ts
import { createClient } from "actor-core/client";
import type { App } from "./src/index";

const client = createClient<App>("http://localhost:6420");
const chatRoom = await client.chatRoom.get();
await chatRoom.sendPrivateMessage(123, 'Hello, world!');
```

</CodeGroup>

## Subscribing from clients

Clients can subscribe to events from actors using `on` and `once`.

### `on(eventName, callback)`

{/* [Documentation](https://jsr.io/@rivet-gg/actor-client/doc/~/ActorHandleRaw.prototype.on.html) */}

Clients can subscribe to events that will happen repeatedly using `actor.on(name, callback)`. For example:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript client.ts
import { createClient } from "actor-core/client";
import type { App } from "./src/index";

const client = createClient<App>("http://localhost:6420");
const chatRoom = await client.chatRoom.get();

chatRoom.on('newMessage', ({ message }) => {
  console.log('Message', message);
});
```

```typescript chat_room.ts
import { actor } from "actor-core";

const chatRoom = actor({
  state: {},
  actions: {
    sendMessage: (c, message) => {
      c.broadcast('newMessage', { message });
    }
  }
});
```

</CodeGroup>

### `once(eventName, callback)`

{/* [Documentation](https://jsr.io/@rivet-gg/actor-client/doc/~/ActorHandleRaw.prototype.once.html) */}

Clients can listen for an event only one time with `actor.once(name, callback)`. For example:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript client.ts
import { createClient } from "actor-core/client";
import type { App } from "./src/index";

const client = createClient<App>("http://localhost:6420");
const chatRoom = await client.chatRoom.get();

chatRoom.once('joinRequestApproved', () => {
  // This will only be called once
  console.log('Join request accepted');
});

await chatRoom.requestJoin();
```

```typescript chat_room.ts
import { actor } from "actor-core";

const chatRoom = actor({
  state: {
    pendingJoinRequests: []
  },
  actions: {
    requestJoin: (c) => {
      // ...add to pending requests...
    },
    approveJoinRequest: (c, connectionId) => {
      const conn = c.connections.find(conn => conn.id === connectionId);
      if (conn) {
        conn.send('joinRequestApproved');
      }
    }
  }
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Connections

Connections are used to communicate with clients from the actor.
