  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    Install the Bun platform package:
    
    ```sh

    ```typescript src/index.ts
    import { serve } from "@rivetkit/bun";
    import { app } from "../workers/app";

    // Start the server with file-system driver (default)
    serve(registry);
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy to production">
    Build and run your production server:

## Using Different Drivers

By default, RivetKit for Bun uses the file-system driver, which persists state between restarts.

For simple deployments, you can switch between drivers with:

```typescript
serve(app, {
  mode: "in-memory",  // Switch to in-memory (file-system is default)
});
```

For production, consider using an alternative driver like [Redis](/drivers/redis).

## Available Regions

Bun typically runs in a single region at a time. For multi-region deployments, consider:

- [Rivet](/platforms/rivet) - Managed cloud service with global deployment
- [Cloudflare Workers](/platforms/cloudflare-workers) - Edge computing with global distribution
