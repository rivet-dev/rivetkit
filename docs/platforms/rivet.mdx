## Deploy

<Steps>
  <StepStartFramework />

  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    Install the Rivet platform package:
    
    <CodeGroup>
      ```sh npm
      npm install @actor-core/rivet
      ```
      
      ```sh pnpm
      pnpm add @actor-core/rivet
      ```
      
      ```sh yarn
      yarn add @actor-core/rivet
      ```
      
      ```sh bun
      bun add @actor-core/rivet
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy to production">
    Deploy your ActorCore application to Rivet:

	<CodeGroup>
	```sh npm
	npx @actor-core/cli@latest deploy rivet actors/app.ts
	```

	```sh pnpm
	pnpm exec @actor-core/cli@latest deploy rivet actors/app.ts
	```

	```sh yarn
	yarn @actor-core/cli@latest deploy rivet actors/app.ts
	```

	```sh bun
	bunx @actor-core/cli@latest deploy rivet actors/app.ts
	```
	</CodeGroup>

    This will:
    1. Prompt you to log in to Rivet if needed
    2. Ask you to select or create a Rivet project
    3. Build and deploy your application
    4. Provide you with your new endpoint

       Update your client code with the new endpoint URL and test your deployed application.
  </Step>

## Accessing Rivet Context

[Rivet's `ActorContext`](https://rivet.gg/docs/javascript-runtime#the-actor-context-object) can be accessed from `createVars`.

```typescript
import { actor } from "actor-core";

const myActor = actor({
  // Load Rivet-specific variables
  createVars: (c, rivet) => ({
    rivet: rivet.ctx,
  }),
  actions: {
    foo: async (c) => {
      // Access ActorContext
      c.log.info(`Region: ${c.vars.rivet.metadata.region.name}`);
      await c.vars.rivet.kv.get("foo");
    },
  }
});
```

## Available Regions

Rivet supports deploying your actors to multiple regions automatically. You can specify region preferences in your Rivet project settings in the Rivet Hub.

See available regions [here](https://rivet.gg/docs/regions).
