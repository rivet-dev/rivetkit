## Create New Project

<Steps>
	<Step title="Create Project with CLI">
		Run this command:

		<CreateActorCli />

		Follow the prompts:
		1. **Where would you like to create your project?** - Choose your project directory
		2. **To which platform would you like to deploy?** - Select Rivet
		3. **Which template would you like to use?** - Select counter, or your template of choice

		The CLI will set up your project and install all dependencies automatically.
	</Step>
	<Step title="Deploy to Rivet">
		Deploy your project to Rivet with:

		```sh
		cd your-project
		npm run deploy
		```

		This will prompt you to:
		1. Login to Rivet and create a project
		2. Select an environment

		After successful deployment, you'll receive important URLs:

		- **Actor Manager URL**: Used for client connections to your actors
		- **Actors Dashboard**: Manage deployed actors and view their status 
		- **Builds Dashboard**: Monitor build history and deployment logs

		Make sure to save your Actor Manager URL as you'll need it to connect from your client code.
	</Step>
	<Step title="Test">
		Update `tests/client.ts` to use the deployed endpoint. Replace the local endpoint in client.ts with your Rivet deployment URL:

		```typescript tests/client.ts
		import { createClient } from "actor-core/client";
		import type { App } from "../src/app";

		// Replace this URL with your Actor Manager URL from the deployment output
		const client = createClient<App>("https://your-actor-manager-url-from-deployment.rivet.run:443");
		
		async function main() {
			const counter = await client.counter.get();
			
			counter.on("newCount", (count: number) => console.log("Event:", count));
			
			const out = await counter.increment(5);
			console.log("Action:", out);
			
			await counter.dispose();
		}
		
		main();
		```

		Then run the client:

		```sh
		npx tsx tests/client.ts
		# Outputs:
		# Event: 5
		# Action: 5
		```

		Run this again to see the state update as the actor maintains its state between calls.
	</Step>
	<Step title="Monitor">
		Monitor your actors, builds, and performance through the Rivet Hub using the links provided in the deployment output:

		- **Actors**: View and manage your deployed actors
		- **Builds**: Review build history and logs
		- **Actor Manager**: Access the actor manager endpoint for direct connections

		Visit the [Rivet Dashboard](https://hub.rivet.gg) to view your project.
