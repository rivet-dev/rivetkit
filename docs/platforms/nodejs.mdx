Node.js provides a robust environment for running ActorCore, ideal for development and production deployments.

## Deploy

<Steps>
  <StepStartFramework />

  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    Install the Node.js platform package:
    
    <CodeGroup>
      ```sh npm
      npm install @actor-core/nodejs
      ```
      
      ```sh pnpm
      pnpm add @actor-core/nodejs
      ```
      
      ```sh yarn
      yarn add @actor-core/nodejs
      ```
      
      ```sh bun
      bun add @actor-core/nodejs
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define your server">
    Create a file `src/index.ts` to start your ActorCore server:

    ```typescript src/index.ts
    import { serve } from "@actor-core/nodejs";
    import { app } from "./app";

    // Start the server with file-system driver (default)
    serve(app);
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy to production">
    Compile your TypeScript code and run the server:

    ```sh
    npx -p typescript tsc
    node dist/index.js
    ```

    Deploy to any cloud provider of your choice.

## Using Different Drivers

By default, ActorCore for Node.js uses the file-system driver, which persists state between restarts.

For simple deployments, you can switch between drivers with:

```typescript
serve(app, {
  mode: "in-memory",  // Switch to in-memory (file-system is default)
});
```

For production, consider using an alternative driver like [Redis](/drivers/redis).

## Available Regions

Node.js typically runs in a single region at a time. For multi-region deployments, consider:

- [Rivet](/platforms/rivet) - Managed cloud service with global deployment
- [Cloudflare Workers](/platforms/cloudflare-workers) - Edge computing with global distribution
