## Quickstart

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new React project">
    Create a new React project with TypeScript support:
    
    <CodeGroup>
      ```sh npm
      npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts
      ```
      
      ```sh pnpm
      pnpm create vite@latest my-app --template react-ts
      ```
      
      ```sh yarn
      yarn create vite my-app --template react-ts
      ```
      
      ```sh bun
      bunx create-vite@latest my-app --template react-ts
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install ActorCore packages">
    Navigate to your React project and install the ActorCore client and React packages:
    
    <CodeGroup>
      ```sh npm
      cd my-app
      npm install actor-core @actor-core/react
      ```
      
      ```sh pnpm
      cd my-app
      pnpm add actor-core @actor-core/react
      ```
      
      ```sh yarn
      cd my-app
      yarn add actor-core @actor-core/react
      ```
      
      ```sh bun
      cd my-app
      bun add actor-core @actor-core/react
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <StepDefineActor />

  <Step title="Build your React frontend">
    Now modify your `src/App.tsx` file to connect to your ActorCore backend:
      
    ```tsx src/App.tsx
    import { createClient } from "actor-core/client";
    import { createReactActorCore } from "@actor-core/react";
    import type { App } from "../actors/app";
    import React, { useState } from "react";

    // Replace with your endpoint URL after deployment
    const client = createClient<App>("http://localhost:6420");
    const { useActor, useActorEvent } = createReactActorCore(client);

    function App() {
      // Connect to counter actor
      const [{ actor }] = useActor("counter");
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
      
      // Listen to count updates
      useActorEvent({ actor, event: "newCount" }, (newCount) => {
        setCount(newCount);
      });

      return (
        <div>
          <p>Count: {count}</p>
          <button 
            onClick={() => actor?.increment(1)}
            disabled={!actor}
          >
            Increment
          </button>
        </div>
      );
    }

    // For Vite + React 18
    import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
    const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!);
    root.render(<App />);
    ```
  </Step>

  <StepRunStudio />

  <Step title="Start your React app">
    In a separate terminal, start your React app:
    
    <CodeGroup>
      ```sh npm
      cd my-app
      npm run dev
      ```
      
      ```sh pnpm
      cd my-app
      pnpm run dev
      ```
      
      ```sh yarn
      cd my-app
      yarn dev
      ```
      
      ```sh bun
      cd my-app
      bun run dev
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
    
    Your React app should now be running and connected to your ActorCore backend. Open your browser to the URL shown in the terminal (typically http://localhost:5173) to see your application.

## API Reference

The React integration leverages React's hooks system to provide an idiomatic way to interact with ActorCore in React applications.

### `createReactActorCore`

The main function that creates React hooks for interacting with ActorCore. It takes a client instance and returns hook functions.

```tsx
const { useActor, useActorEvent } = createReactActorCore(client);
```

#### Parameters

- `client`: The ActorCore client created with `createClient`.

#### Returns

An object containing React hooks:
- `useActor`: Hook for connecting to actors
- `useActorEvent`: Hook for subscribing to actor events

### `useActor`

Hook that connects to an actor, creating it if necessary. It manages the actor connection and returns the actor handle.

```tsx
const [{ actor, error, isLoading, state }] = useActor(actorName, options);
```

#### Parameters

- `actorName`: The name of the actor to connect to (string).
- `options`: Optional connection options (same options as `client.actorName.get()`).
  - `id`: String identifier for the actor instance.
  - `tags`: Key-value pairs for actor identification.
  - `params`: Parameters to pass during connection.
  - `noCreate`: Boolean to prevent actor creation if it doesn't exist.

#### Returns

Returns an array with a single object containing:
- `actor`: The actor handle if connected, or `undefined` if still connecting.
- `error`: Any error that occurred during connection.
- `isLoading`: Boolean indicating if the connection is in progress.
- `state`: String representing the internal connection state ("init", "creating", "created", or "error").

### `useActorEvent`

Hook that subscribes to events from an actor.

```tsx
useActorEvent({ actor, event }, cb);
```

#### Parameters

- `opts`: Object containing:
  - `actor`: The actor handle from `useActor`, or undefined.
  - `event`: The name of the event to subscribe to.
- `cb`: Function called when the event is fired. The arguments passed to this function depend on the event type.

#### Returns

This hook doesn't return a value. The subscription is automatically managed by the hook lifecycle.

## Example Usage

### Simple Counter

```tsx
import { createClient } from "actor-core/client";
import { createReactActorCore } from "@actor-core/react";
import type { App } from "../actors/app";
import { useState } from "react";

// Connect to ActorCore
const client = createClient<App>("http://localhost:6420");
const { useActor, useActorEvent } = createReactActorCore(client);

function Counter() {
  // Get actor and track count
  const [{ actor }] = useActor("counter");
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  // Listen for count updates
  useActorEvent({ actor, event: "newCount" }, setCount);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => actor?.increment(1)} disabled={!actor}>
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
