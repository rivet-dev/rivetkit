The ActorCore JavaScript client allows you to connect to and interact with actors from browser and Node.js applications.

## Installation

Install the ActorCore client package:

<CodeGroup>
```sh npm
npm add actor-core
```

```sh pnpm
pnpm add actor-core
```

```sh yarn
yarn add actor-core
```

```sh bun
bun add actor-core
```
</CodeGroup>

## Connecting to an Actor

```typescript
import { createClient } from "actor-core/client";
import type { App } from "./app";  // Import type of ActorCore app for end-to-end type safety

// Create a client with the connection address
const client = createClient<App>("http://localhost:6420");

// Connect to an actor
const counter = await client.counter.get({ id: "counter-1" });

// Listen for events
counter.on("newCount", (count) => {
	console.log(`Count updated: ${count}`);
});

// Call an action on the actor
const newCount = await counter.increment(5);
console.log(`New count: ${newCount}`);
```

## Next Steps

See the [Interacting with Actors](/concepts/interacting-with-actors) documentation for information on how to use the client.
